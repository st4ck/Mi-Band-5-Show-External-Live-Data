# Mi Band 5 - Show external live data through Music Player
Project for Android using music player to transmit live data to the mi band and show to the screen in the player

## Why
Customizing (and unlocking) Mi Band 5 could not be so easy and there are so many reason you wouldn't do it, including continue to use Mi Fit application.
For this reasong I created a sketch of a Music Player using Media Notifications. It's just a workaround but work smoothly in my case
To show how it works I push every 30 seconds stock data from Amazon AWS through the player
